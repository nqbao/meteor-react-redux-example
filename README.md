# meteor-react-redux-example

This is a sample TODO app written in Meteor, React, and Redux. I start from tutorial app from Meteor and continue
the integration from that, so most of the UI is from [here](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app). I use this as a sandbox to explore the possibility to 
integrate these frameworks together.

# Goal

The goal of this exploration is to propose an integration approach that:

  * Follow strictly [three principles](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html) from Redux.
  * Provide a clear guideline how to use Meteor API like Collection, Subscription, Method, etc within Redux.
  * Embrace best practices from all frameworks.
